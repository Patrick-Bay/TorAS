# TorAS

An ActionScript implementation of the Tor control and communication (SOCKS5) protocols.

The TorAS library comes bundled with the binary Tor client which can be launched by a Windows AIR application as an invisible background process -- no extra installation or setup required. Once connected, TorAS gives ActionScript developers control over their Tor network connection, as well as providing simplified access to the secure, anonymous communication channels for which Tor is famous. TorAS supports HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for extra security.

Except for incorporating open source Tor technology, TorAS is no way associated with the Tor Project - any internal naming schemes (such as reverse domain notation for classes), are used for clarity, appropriateness, and the likelihood of avoiding namespace collisions. The Tor project does not control, advise, or endorse TorAS in any way.
